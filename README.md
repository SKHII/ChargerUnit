# ChargerUnit
Contained in this repository are the design files for my <i>ChargerUnit</i> project.

So far the three STL files are the 3D prints. They will need to be rotated before printing. I will re-upload correctly orientated STL files later on.

The WinZip file contains the Geber files, in ready for manufacture state. I have been slight changes not already reflected on the project logs.

It goes without saying, I am not liable nor do I guarantee anything.
